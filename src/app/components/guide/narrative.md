# Guide Component

Mostly I just didn't want to create some big navigation thing yet.

So the sort of "home page". 

Added a link to this in the masthead component.

Notice the slashie on the `routerLink` - need to tell the router to go "up" one level to do navigation.

An option would be to have THIS be the navigation this, and add a `router-outlet`, and change the examples to children in the routes?
